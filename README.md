# Webpack5 Builder

> Webpack5 Builder provides simple commands for building up package.json and webpack.config for a webpack5 project

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'webpack5-builder'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install webpack5-builder
```

## Stories

### Main Story

As a SPA Developer, I want to configure webpack5 enabled applications quickly, so I don&amp;#x27;t have to be a WebPack5 expert

See all [stories](./STORIES.md)

## Usage

See all [usage examples](./USAGE.md)

### Basic Example

#### Basic example

Description for a basic example to be featured in the main README.MD file

```ruby
class SomeRuby; end
```

## Development

Checkout the repo

```bash
git clone klueless-io/webpack5-builder
```

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

```bash
bin/console

Aaa::Bbb::Program.execute()
# => ""
```

`webpack5-builder` is setup with Guard, run `guard`, this will watch development file changes and run tests automatically, if successful, it will then run rubocop for style quality.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, build the gem and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

```bash
gem build
gem push rspec-usecases-?.?.??.gem
# or push the latest gem
ls *.gem | sort -r | head -1 | xargs gem push
```
